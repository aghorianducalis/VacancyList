Database migrations

php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate


Database seeding

php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load

Pass the --group option to load only the fixtures associated with those groups. For example

php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --group=dou --append

By default the load command purges the database, removing all data from every table.
To append your fixturesâ€™ data add the --append option.
